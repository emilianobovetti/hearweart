  <p class="heavy-top-margin">Hear We Art is a charitable project enabling a small group of British, Italian and this year, local Sri Lankan professional artists, designers, other creatives to develop and deliver, once a year, workshops to <strong>poor, deaf Sri Lankan children</strong> aged between 10 and 18 (some of whom are also orphans,) who attend the <a href="https://senkadagaladbs.blogspot.com/">Senkadagala Boarding School</a> in Kandy, Sri Lanka.</p>

  <p>The workshops consist of Graphic Design, Photography, Wood Carving and Mural Art, all of which are <strong>seen as priorities by the school</strong>. The teaching methods have been carefully developed to deal with and embrace language differences and communication challenges, so as <strong>allow the children to develop their dormant creative abilities</strong> and <strong>not be inhibited by their</strong> disabilities.</p>

  <p class="heavy-bottom-margin">Senkadagala school receives state funding and must therefore follow the <strong>national curriculum</strong>, which makes no concession to, and offers no special support for, children with disabilities, consequently, the great majority struggle, leave school with very low educational attainment and with no vocational skills. Combined with their disabilities, this means, <strong>regardless of talent, they are condemned to do the most menial, poorly paid jobs, assuming they are able to find any work at all</strong>.</p>

  <ul>
    <h2>Hear We Art's key aims are:</h2>

    <li>Help the children acquire vocationally oriented skills and capabilities which are potentially <strong>transformative in terms of their prospects of finding economically worthwhile and fulfilling work</strong>.</li>

    <li><strong>Boost the children’s confidence and self-esteem</strong> and at the same time <strong>bring joy, pride and sense of achievement</strong>. Thereby reinforce their commitment to the school.</li>

    <img class="medium-right-margin medium-bottom-margin float-left pure-u-1 pure-u-sm-1-2" src="{{ 'assets/img/about-2.jpg' | relative_url }}">

    <li>Fully involve, train and transfer skills to Senkadagala’s teachers so as to be able progress to a point where they have the ability to run such programmes on their own.</li>

    <li class="heavy-bottom-margin"><strong>Involve local creatives and craftsmen</strong> in the programme, to both promote the objective developing autonomy and help build links to the community which can help children transition to much more worthwhile work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Hear We Art piloted the first <a href="{{ '2017-pilot-program' | relative_url }}">workshops in 2017</a>, which were <strong>judged a great success</strong> by the children, their families, the teachers and the school management all of whom insist we return in 2018! Here just a few comments:</p>

    <blockquote>It is a beautiful workshop tailored for the students’ needs and this is something we miss lot. Students have many benefits and learned a lot about Graphic Design and Mural painting. We hope you come again!</blockquote>
    <p>Darshani Kumari Dissanayake, school coordinator</p>

    <blockquote>Many people today are complaining about present times, they say that the world is getting worst and people are more selfish forgetting about the true values. Hear We Art is a live proof that this is not true.</blockquote>
    <p>Mrs. B.B.Gamage, school principal</p>

    <blockquote>Thank you I really liked the course. I learned how many things that are intuitive to me can be actually used in graphic design to make great composition and images and used to sell and decorate products. Please come back and show us more!</blockquote>
    <p>Tharindu Vishvajith Morawaliyadda, student</p>

    <!--
    <blockquote>This workshop not only gave students practical information, but it also set an example for its enthusiastic tutors and the love and passion that has been transmitted with the project. Everybody in the school has been inspired by that.</blockquote>
    <p>School teacher</p>

  <blockquote>The school motto is centered upon the happiness of these needy kids, and administration believes that this would be an instant success among the children.
    <strong>Let me elaborate on the importance of your project to the school</strong>. I recently indulged the school children with a treat for my birthday, and I noticed some children with extreme frustration. The matron informed me that the communication barrier is the reason for their frustration. These children need some form to express their feelings and thoughts. Your suggested proposal is beyond ideal for these kids.</blockquote>
