    <p class="heavy-top-margin">Hear We Art is a charitable project enabling a small group of British, Italian and this year, local Sri Lankan professional artists, designers, other creatives to develop and deliver, once a year, workshops to <strong>poor, deaf Sri Lankan children</strong> aged between 5 and 16 (some of whom are also orphans,) who attend the <a href="https://senkadagaladbs.blogspot.com/">Senkadagala Boarding School</a> in Kandy, Sri Lanka.</p>

    <p>The workshops consist of  Graphic Design, Photography, Wood Carving and Mural Art, all of which are <strong>seen as priorities by the school</strong>. The teaching methods have been carefully developed to deal with and embrace language differences and communication challenges, so as <strong>allow the children to develop their dormant creative abilities</strong> and <strong>not be inhibited by their</strong> disabilities (for further detail click here).</p>

    <p class="heavy-bottom-margin">Senkadagala school receives state funding and must therefore follow the <strong>national curriculum</strong>, which makes no concession to, and offers no special support for, children with disabilities, consequently, the great majority struggle, leave school with very low educational attainment and with no vocational skills. Combined with their disabilities, this means, <strong>regardless of talent, they are condemned to do the most menial, poorly paid jobs, assuming they are able to find any work at all</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Hear We Art has clearly defined aims, key among which are to:</h2>

      <li>Help the children acquire vocationally oriented skills and capabilities which are potentially <strong>transformative in terms of their prospects of finding economically worthwhile and fulfilling work</strong>.</li>

      <li><strong>Boost the children’s confidence and self-esteem</strong> and at the same time <strong>bring joy, pride and sense of achievement</strong>. Thereby reinforce their commitment to the school.</li>

      <li>Fully involve, train and transfer skills to Senkadagala’s teachers so as to be able progress to a stage where they have the ability to run such programmes on their own.</li>

      <li class="heavy-bottom-margin"><strong>Involve local creatives and craftsmen</strong> in the programme, to both promote the objective developing autonomy and help build links to the community which can help children transition to much more worthwhile work.</li>
