  <h1>2017 Pilot Program</h1>

  <p>With the support and help of Nigel, in 2016, Olga visited Sri Lanka to look for underprivileged groups of children who could potentially benefit from Art, Handicraft and Design workshops and met the Principal of Senkadagala School. Discussions quickly led to the development of Hear We Art. In 2017 Olga, led the team (comprising herself, Alessia and Morgan,) which successfully piloted the first Hear We Art series of workshops.</p>

  <h2>The Process</h2>

  <p class="heavy-bottom-margin">To implement the Graphic Design course and communicate with the children, slides made up of simple English sentences, drawings and other images were projected, while a teacher helped with translation into Sinhalese sign language. We were asked to show the slides in English, not Sinhalese, so to <strong>help children learn the language at the same time</strong>!</p>

  <p class="heavy-vertical-margin">The mural course was much more focussed on self-expression, but required the help of English speaking Sri Lankan tutors to translate the brief to the children. We learned to use and ‘speak’ basic sign language, which we found very intuitive. Our interactions were full of expressive gestures. <strong>Clear communication was not an issue, rather, a fun and creative exploration</strong>.</p>

  <p class="heavy-vertical-margin">The workshops with the visually impaired students were very interesting. Since we knew that the blind students had never participated in an art class before, but have regular music classes, working together, we managed to create a system which explained the concept of ‘pattern’ using music and rhythm. The blind teacher translated from English to Sinhalese and adopted our metaphor, making a live example of how a pattern would look like. When it was time to put theory into practice, we gave each student a sheet of paper, on which we previously had created an embossed grid, using a glue gun. This functioned as a “map” for the students to interact with and into which they could apply a collage of cut out and textured shapes.</p>

   <p class="heavy-vertical-margin">As requested by the teacher, we also made a few simple glue gun layers of fruit and vegetables and student portraits to be filled with paper collage.</p>

  <p class="heavy-vertical-margin">At the end of the four weeks, we organized an exhibition which showcased all the work done during the course of the workshops. The children helped us, setting up their drawings and pictures and enjoyed looking at their own beautiful artwork on the walls. We were very surprised when the principal, teachers and the kids took us to the main hall where they had organized a goodbye ceremony and where they talked about the benefits and enjoyment the workshops and meeting us had brought them. We were given wonderful cards and presents too!</p>
