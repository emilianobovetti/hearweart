<h1>The 2018 workshops and teaching methods</h1>

<p>This year, we will be running four courses: Graphic Design, Photography, Wood Carving and Mural Art. The three main courses are aimed at giving students some work-related skills which will help them in find a much better place in the community, economically and socially, when they finish their studies:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Our graphic design course</strong> will teach the basics of GIMP, a very popular graphic software that is used in many work environments. Thanks to Nigel, last year we purchased eight computers for the school and this year we plan to add another four.</li>

  <li>The <strong>photography</strong> course will teach the children how to use cameras, the art of photographic composition and picture editing. This is the first time we will have run this course, so we plan to buy ten cameras to get the workshops underway. The cameras will be left to the school for use during the year and in future courses.</li>

  <li>The <strong>wood carving</strong> course, with the support of local artisans, will focus on teaching deaf students basic handcraft skills. This will help them learn how to both make simple objects, with a view to this potentially becoming a way to earn money and at the same time , allow them express themselves creatively.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to the above, the children will create a special <strong>tactile mural</strong> for the school. This will be done using specially selected materials to facilitate the full participation of visually-impaired students, allowing them the opportunity to express their creativity, whilst developing their dexterity.</p>

<p>This year, as alluded to already, we’ve decided to involve local experts in our workshops. This will permit teachers, none of whom currently have any professional expertise, to radically up skill with the aim of them being able to manage similar classes and workshops without any external support. The integration of local experts will also create tangible links between the school and the community, fostering the possibility of integrating deaf and blind children in the productive world, when they leave school.</p>

<h2>Our teaching methods</h2>

<p>We firmly believe that art is a universal language, however, we know that teaching art and creative subjects to students with major physical impairments brings particular challenges, even more so when there are language and cultural differences to be transcended. Capitalising on the experience gained in 2017 and using our professional expertise, we have devoted a lot time effort to developing, bespoke, Hear We Art teaching methods, techniques and instruments, in order that they are totally fit for purpose, right from day one.</p>

<p>Not only does this means our teaching techniques help ensure the students learn in very effective ways, but also that the effects are long-lasting, can be built upon and the environment is stress free and highly enjoyable, despite the many challenges.</p>

<p>Last year we focused on developing specific tools and techniques, such as the visual grid, which we created in order to teach to our visually impaired students how graphic patterns work.</p>

<p>Building on the success of last year’s graphic design workshops, in 2018, we’ll be focused on teaching our blind students more graphic rudiments, using a method which unites the perception of rhythm and visual patterns. We’ll be teaching new techniques to help our hearing-impaired students learn GIMP. In this way, they’ll be able to gain precious work place related skills and thus  avoid the isolation that many disabled people experience in the rural economies in Sri Lanka.</p>
