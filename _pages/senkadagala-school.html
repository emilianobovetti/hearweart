    <p class="no-margin medium-bottom-margin">Senkadagala Deaf and Blind School, in Kandy, Sri Lanka, was founded in 1962, by the president of the Ceylon Association for the Blind, as a boarding school for children aged 3 to 18, from all over the country. The school hostel provides food and accommodation, free of charge, as most of the children come from very poor families in rural parts of the country. As government financial resources are very limited, the school also relies on the support of The International Philanthropic Society of Sweden, whose funding is used to improve children’s health, hygiene and living conditions. The school also receives support from private patrons who help meet the cost of food and maintenance.</p>

    <p class="no-margin">Since its foundation, Senkadagala School has striven to promote the children’s well-being and their integration into the local environment. However, the school has to follow the unified national school curriculum which means the children have to follow the same program as every other school in the country. As the curriculum is not at all adapted to children’s disabilities, most if not all struggle to keep-up, especially with academic subjects. Whilst many of the pupils are very talented in art and creative subjects, unfortunately these have no place in the normal state curriculum. The school has almost no resource, or expertise, to teach creative subjects, nor provide any vocationally oriented education.</p>

<p>As a result, the children usually leave school with poor academic results which means few are able to move on to further education and the absence of vocational training means the great majority of pupils have to get unskilled, very poorly paid work, if they find anything at all.</p>

<p>To help the children develop and capitalize on their natural creative abilities, the School Board decided to introduce a few afternoon classes, led by volunteer tutors, in subjects such as computing, photography, graphic design, woodcarving and dress making. But often the teachers have quite limited knowledge of and experience in teaching these subjects. Hear We Art’s workshops have been specifically designed and developed, not only to give the pupils much enhanced exposure to these subjects, but also to very significantly up-skill the teachers’ abilities to teach them.</p>
