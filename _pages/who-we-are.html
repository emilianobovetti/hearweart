    <h1>The <em>Hear We Art</em> Team</h1>

    <p>We are a group of artists, creatives and designers who work together to create workshops tailored to the needs of students with visual and hearing impairments.</p>

    <p>The Hear We Art project leader is Olga Hendel. Nigel Bartram helped develop and finance the original Hear We Art concept and Pilot Programme in 2017. He continues to support the project out of a wish to help, directly, children in need, especially those who must overcome disabilities and require support to have any chance of living an independent and fulfilling life.</p>
