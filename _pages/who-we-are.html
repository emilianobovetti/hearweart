    <h2>The <em>Hear We Art</em> Team</h2>

    <p>We are a group of artists, creatives and designers who working together to create workshops tailored to the needs of students with visual and hearing impairments.</p>

    <p>The Hear We Art project leader is Olga Hendel. The programmes have been developed by Sekme Art Lab (international group fo artist) and Studio Arco (an Italian Ong). The group is is made up of professional creative practitioners and artists with years of experience in teaching disadvantaged young people in UK, Italy, India and Australia. We have joined forces to create a comprehensive set of workshops which include the Arts in many different forms: Graphic Design, Craft Making and Mural Art. Nigel Bartram helped develop and finance the original Hear We Art concept and continues to support the project out of a wish to help, directly, children in need, especially those who must overcome disabilities and require support to have any chance of living a fulfilled life.</p>

    <p class="heavy-margin-bottom">The project is endorsed by Nigel Bartram, a philanthropist who is dedicating his life to help children in need. Nigel is the director of school in Paris and is now working towards setting up a UK charity.</p>
