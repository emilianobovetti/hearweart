    <h1>The <em>Hear We Art</em> Team</h1>

    <p>We are a group of artists, creatives and designers who work together to create workshops tailored to the needs of students with visual and hearing impairments.</p>

    <p>The Hear We Art project leader is Olga Hendel. Nigel Bartram helped develop and finance the original Hear We Art concept and Pilot Programme in 2017. He continues to support the project out of a wish to help, directly, children in need, especially those who must overcome disabilities and require support to have any chance of living an independent and fulfilling life.</p>

    <p class="no-margin">Olga graduated from Camberwell College of Arts in 2015 and since then has been working as a freelance artist in Rome. In 2012 she co-founded IdenticonArts, a LdT Community Interest Company, based in London, whose objective is to work with disadvantaged groups, from youngsters through  to the elderly, encouraging self-expression through art and craft making. Among the other workshops she has delivered are the Skills Show at the Birmingham Festival, Art for inclusion in Ukraine and Sp8 for Arts London. She also curated a project which produced QUIET! Magazine, participated in the Homegrown festival in Brixton and  the AR.CO laboratory.</p>

    <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">With the support and help of Nigel, in 2016, Olga visited Sri Lanka to look for underprivileged groups of children who could potentially benefit from Art, Handicraft and Design workshops and met the Principal of Senkadagala School. Discussions quickly led to the development of Hear We Art. In 2017 Olga, led the team (comprising herself, Alessia and Morgan – see below) which successfully piloted the first Hear We Art series of workshops.</p>
