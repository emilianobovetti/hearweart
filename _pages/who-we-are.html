<h1>The Hear We Art Team</h1>

<p>We are a group of artists, creatives and designers who work together to create workshops tailored to the needs of students with visual and hearing impairments.</p>

<p>The Hear We Art project leader is Olga Hendel. Nigel Bartram helped develop and finance the original Hear We Art concept and Pilot Programme in 2017. He continues to support the project out of a wish to help, directly, children in need, especially those who must overcome disabilities and require support to have any chance of living an independent and fulfilling life.</p>

<div class="no-margin heavy-bottom-margin pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p class="no-margin">Olga graduated from Camberwell College of Arts in 2015 and since then has been working as a freelance artist in Rome. In 2012 she co-founded IdenticonArts, a LdT Community Interest Company, based in London, whose objective is to work with disadvantaged groups, from youngsters through  to the elderly, encouraging self-expression through art and craft making. Among the other workshops she has delivered are the Skills Show at the Birmingham Festival, Art for inclusion in Ukraine and Sp8 for Arts London. She also curated a project which produced QUIET! Magazine, participated in the Homegrown festival in Brixton and  the AR.CO laboratory.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">With the support and help of Nigel, in 2016, Olga visited Sri Lanka to look for underprivileged groups of children who could potentially benefit from Art, Handicraft and Design workshops and met the Principal of Senkadagala School. Discussions quickly led to the development of Hear We Art. In 2017 Olga, led the team (comprising herself, Alessia and Morgan – see below) which successfully piloted the first Hear We Art series of workshops.</p>

<h2 class="dark-gray font-weight-normal">Nigel Bartam</h2>

<div class="no-margin heavy-bottom-margin pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p class="no-margin">HearWeArt’s patron and co-founder is British, retired and lives with his wife, Caroline, in France.  Most of his UK career was in Financial Services and was followed by a move to France in the late 1990’s and complete change of direction, founding a language school and becoming a part time university Associate Professor.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">A less welcome change was the arrival of Multiple Sclerosis, but a decided sliver-lining came in the form of getting to know Olga Hendel. She had volunteered to illustrate stories for a book Nigel is editing called, ‘MS A funny thing (sometimes)’, the stories being funny things which have happened to ‘MSers’ only because of their MS. The objective is to bring much needed smiles to the faces of MSers, their loved ones, carers etc. raise money for MS charities and  awareness of how lives are affected by the illness. Please have a look at <a href="www.msafunnything.com">msafunnything.com</a>.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">Nigel and Caroline have two children and through a small charity (the Lotus Foundation), have given money to help with the education of poor Sri Lankan children, especially providing basics foryoung ones and bursaries for university for the older kids. When Nigel became aware that Olga wished to help children in developing countries through Art, he suggested a project in Sri Lanka based on his Lotus Foundation experience and old university friend with business interests there. After some deliberation and planning, he and Caroline funded an investigatory visit in 2016 and the 2017 pilot programme.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">Today, Nigel raises money for and underwrites HearWeArt, with Olga sets the objectives and priorities for the programmes and monitors the results and agrees budgets and expenditure.</p>

<h2 class="dark-gray font-weight-normal">Niroshan Bandara</h2>

<div class="no-margin heavy-bottom-margin pure-u-1 pure-u-md-1-2">
  <p class="no-margin">Overcoming the serious disability of having no arms, which means Niroshan has to use his toes to operate a computer keyboard, he has developed a successful international career as a 2D and 3D graphic designer. After graduating from University of Moratuwa, in Sri Lanka, with a Bachelor of Design in Graphics & Visual Communication, Niroshan spent three years as an intern Motion Graphic Artist at MTV in the US where he developed his 2D / 3D Animation skills, learned to share ideas, and problem-solve in a high-pressured environment. Niroshan created many storyboards which formed the basis of US local and international TV advertisements as well as developing many graphic themes for MTV.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">In the three years since he returned from the US, Niroshan has built up a business as  a freelance artist, developing a portfolio of local Sri Lankan and international clients, He’s also now a visiting lecturer on  for graphic web & interactive design and animation in several Sri Lankan universities and academies.</p>

  <p class="no-margin medium-top-margin">We are delighted to be working with Niroshan, not only for the graphic design skills and experience he brings, but also because it marks an important step in our aim of Hear We Art transitioning to being a programme which locals will be able to deliver autonomously. And perhaps most important of all, Niroshan will give the children a huge motivational boost, showing how it is perfectly possible to succeed despite having to overcome serious disabilities.</p>
