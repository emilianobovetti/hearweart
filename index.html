    <p><em>Hear We Art is a project which will be specifically designed for the hearing and visually impaired, including children from 4 to 18 years old.</em></p>

    <p>Hear We Art will aim to enrich children skills and abilities in practical artmaking. Our strong believe is that the arts have the capacity to developsocial equity, interdependence and empowerment. It is therefore importantthat the arts are available to as many young people as possible. As The UNConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and Convention onthe Rights of the Child recognize: access to the arts is a fundamental rightfor all children and young people, the child has the right to participatefreely in cultural life and have equal opportunities for cultural, artistic,recreational and leisure activities!</p>

    <h4>Our Goal</h4>

    <p>The principal benefits the programme will deliver are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using recycled materials such as newspaper, plastic lids, used containers, cardboard therefore learning about eco-friendly art and sustainability.</li>

      <li>Full, hands-on induction for the teachers and pupils to GIMP Graphic Design software, as specifically requested by the school board.</li>

      <li>This will begin a process of enhancement of the children’s career and employment prospects in Graphic Design. (To be developed in 2018)</li>

      <li>Boost the children’s confidence, self-esteem and sense of commitment to their studies overall, and to the school.</li>

      <li>Have lots of fun and enjoyment. We all know how all kids the world over love technology and ‘getting their hands dirty’!</li>

      <li>Collaborate with people form different cultures and backgrounds. Exchange their creative viewpoint with artists from Rome and London to create an international inspiring collaboration.</li>
    </ul>

​   <blockquote>Many people today are complaining about present times, they say that the world is getting worst and people are more selfish forgetting about the true values. Hear We Art is a live proof that this is not true.</blockquote>

    School Principal Gamage

    <blockquote>Thank you I really liked the course. I learned how many things that are intuitive to me can be actually used in graphic design to make great composition and images and used to sell and decorate products. Please come back and show us more!</blockquote>

    Student

    <blockquote>This workshop not only gave students practical information but it also set an example for its enthusiastic tutors and the love and passion that has been transmitted with the project. Everybody in the school has been inspired by that.</blockquote>
