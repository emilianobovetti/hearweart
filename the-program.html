<h1>2017 Program</h1>

<p class="heavy-margin">Hear we art’s pilot project proposed several classes in two main subjects, Graphic Design and Mural Art. The first being a more technical and skills oriented course, and the second more expressive and creative. Graphic Design course was developed by Alessia Arcuri and Olga Hendel and is divided in six different classes. Design Principals, Poster Making, Computer graphic software, Print Making, Book Binding and Tactile collage.</p>

  <h3 class="uppercase no-margin">The Process</h3>
  <p class="no-margin">communication, teaching and learning</p>

  <p class="heavy-margin">To implement the Graphic Design course and communicate with the children we used projected slides while a teacher helped with translation in sign language. The slides contained simple English sentences but also drawing and images. We were asked to show the slides in English so that would help children learn the language too! Mural course was more about self expression but we also used some help from English speaking tutors to translate the brief. Also we learned to speak basic sign language, which we found really intuitive and interaction was full of expressive gestures and so communication was not an issue but a fun and creative exploration. With the visually impaired students it was very interesting workshop. Since we know that the blind students had never participated to an art class but have regular music classes, managed to create a system which would explain the concept of pattern though the idea of music and rhythm. The blind teacher translated from English to Sengalese and adopted our metaphor making a live example of how a pattern would “look like”. When it was time to apply theory in practice, we give each student their piece of paper where we previously had made an embossed grid using glue gun, which would function as a “map” for the students to interact with, into which apply a collage of cut out and textured shapes. As requested by the teacher we also made a few simple glue gun layers of fruit an vegetable and student portraits to be filled with paper collage.</p>

  <p class="heavy-margin">At the end of the four weeks we organized an exhibition that showcased all the work done during the courses. Children helped us setting up their drawings and pictures and enjoyed watching their own beautiful artwork on the wall. We were very surprised when the principal, teachers and the kids brought us to the main hall where they had organized a good bye ceremony, in which they talked about the benefits of the workshops and meeting us. We have been given wonderful cards and presents too!</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin uppercase blue">Workshop 1</h3>
  <h2 class="light-vertical-margin">Design Principles: Learning the Basics</h2>

  <p><strong>Course Length</strong>: 4-6 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Students will be shown how Graphic Design employs colours, letters and visuals to communicate messages clearly.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, students will be shown the basic principles of Graphic Designs (such as scale, alignment, typography, proximity etc)</p>

  <p><strong>Course Structure</strong>: Through quick, hand-on activities, students will learn how to apply these design principles onto paper by working on small card tiles. These designs will be used to cover a wall and to decorate objects such as cards and notebook.</p>

  <p>Also in this case, the workshop will be amended according to the age of the kids. Materials necessary for the workshop will be provided.</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin uppercase blue">Workshop 2</h3>
  <h2 class="light-vertical-margin">Poster Art: computer software and Graphic Design</h2>

  <p><strong>Course Length</strong>: 4-6 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: Students will understand the basic of layout and poster making by working with visual and typography. Each student will create a self portrait poster using a printed A3 photo as a starting point.</p>

  <p><strong>Course Structure</strong>: Students aging 16 or more, will have a chance to learn basic post-production techniques using GIMP - an open source graphic design software. They will learn how to tweak images by using brightness, contrasts, levels, filters etc.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, they will join younger kids in analogue techniques of poster making, such as painting and collage. Computer will be provied by Sekeme Lab and it will be donated to the school.</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin uppercase blue">Workshop 3</h3>
  <h2 class="light-vertical-margin">Printing Patterns: Printing Techniques and Pattern Making</h2>

  <p><strong>Course Length</strong>: 4-6 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: students will explore basic printing techniques on a variety of media (A5 cards and tote bags or fabric).</p>

  <p>The workshop will focus on exploring patterns, repetition and composition.</p>

  <p><strong>Course Structure</strong>: a brief introduction will illustrate the basics of pattern making. Subsequently the students will be shown how to create patterns using two different techniques: block printing and printing with recycled materials. The workshop will be amended according to the age of the children. Older students will engage in more complicate tasks whilst young children  be shown simpler techniques. We will provide the materials needed for the workshop, such as paper, fabric, acrylics etc.</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin uppercase blue">Workshop 4</h3>
  <h2 class="light-vertical-margin">Book Binding and Cover Design</h2>

  <p>Learning about typography and layout to create a simple book cover</p>

  <p><strong>Course Length</strong>: 4-6 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: using as a starting point a typical Sri Lankan Folk tale or Aesop tale, students will be asked to design a layout for the cover. Students will deepen their understanding of layout and composition by working with text and images.</p>

  <p>The story will be printed onto A5 white pages, so the students will create a cover for the zine and staple-bind it.</p>

  <p>Younger kids will probably approach the workshop from a more illustrative approach, whilst older one will test how to apply design principles to the artwork.</p>

  <h3 class="no-margin uppercase blue">Mural Painting</h3>
  <h2 class="light-vertical-margin">Learning Painting Techniques and Mural Art</h2>

  <p><strong>Course Length</strong>: 15 hours</p>

  <p><strong>Objectives</strong>: students will also engage in the creation of a mural, during the conceptual development of the design based on their drawing contributions and both during the practical process of painting it.</p>

  <p><strong>Course Structure</strong>: divided into small groups, kids will learn the basics of mural painting, how to treat the wall, apply paint on the surface, brush techniques and mix colours. With a touch sensory 3D element to the composition for the blind children to engage with. (large scale brail + silicone outlines)</p>

  <p>Spraypainting a 3 colour stencilling process will also be demonstrated with poster paste ups made to spark inspiration + to act as an icebreaker</p>
