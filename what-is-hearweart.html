  <h3 class="uppercase">Senkadagala School</h3>

  <div class="light-margin">
    <p>Hear we Art has been developed specifically for Senkadagala school of deaf and blind. The school is composed by 87 deaf students and 5 blind students and has been funded in 1962, by a blind teacher Rienzie Alagiyawanna. The school is public and the children have free access and healthcare once they get in. However being a public school their funding are limited as they come from the government and many teachers who work there are volunteers.</p>

    <p>The school has to follow national curriculum so they need to study as regular education students in Sri Lanka. This means that the children have to learn to read and write as well as learning deaf language. In the school they also learn English and international deaf language. Most of the children struggle in keeping up with theorical subjects but they are very talented in art and expressive classes. As a result after school students get to access practical jobs and only few are able to get to further education. To meet the children natural abilities, the school board have decided to introduce a few afternoon classes, lead by volunteering tutors on subjects such as computer, photography, graphic design, woodcarving and dress making. Therefore the school teachers and principal were very happy when we presented the project, and were happy to have us there, as we are not only offering a fun experience and material supply but also a valuable training project which can empower the kids for the years to come.</p>

  <h3 class="uppercase">Tutor Darshi Says</h3>
​
  <div class="light-horizontal-margin">
    <p class="dark-orange">Deaf students really like practical subjects more than the writing and theorical subjects. Studying in Sri Lanka is more difficult for deaf students because they have to learn language, plus sign language and all the subjects at the same time.</p>

    <p>Senghalese language is a very complicated language so it’s a bit hard for them to learn as a result it is so hard for them to express themselves, their feeling and emotions and communicate to the outer world. The can only speak the sign language but not everybody speak the sign language. I think art is a very good method to express their emotions, talents and views.</p>

    <p>In our school we are following the same curriculum as other schools so most of the deaf students don’t have to opportunity to do well in their exams. So we think it’s a good idea to include vocational courses in the school. Because most of the student when they pass their examination they go to vocational training or work so it is helpful to have possibility to start vocational courses already in school.</p>

    <p>After they complete the examination they go in training in vocational courses or find other jobs. We have many vocational training center conducted by the social servicees department in the government but some students are not able to go there because their parents have a low income and cannot support their education so they are forced to find a job. Most of them find placement in the government factories where they will do ironing, cleaning, taking care of stock packaging and so on.</p>

    <p>I believe that this children should have the same opportunity as anybody else to find a job or follow a passion.</p>
