    <p class="medium-vertical-margin">We are a group of artists, creatives and designers working together to create workshop tailored to students with visual and hearing impairments.</p>

    <p class="medium-vertical-margin">The project is coordinated by Olga Hendel and has been developed by Sekme Art Lab (an international group of artists working toghether as a collective). The collective is composed by professional creative practitioners together with artists who have years of experience in teaching disadvantaged young people in UK, Italy, India and Australia and are joining forces to give life to a very comprehensive project that will include the Arts in many different forms: Graphic Design, Craft Making and Mural Art.</p>

    <p class="medium-vertical-margin">The project is endorsed by Nigel Bartram, a philanthropist who is dedicating his life to help children in need. Nigel is the director of school in Paris and is now working towards setting up a UK charity.</p>
